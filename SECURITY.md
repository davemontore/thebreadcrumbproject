## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in The Breadcrumb Project, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do Not Create a Public Issue**

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent potential exploitation.

### 2. **Email the Maintainers**

Send a detailed email to the project maintainers with the following information:

- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - [Brief Description]`
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have a suggested solution
- **Your Contact Information**: How we can reach you

### 3. **What to Include**

Please provide as much detail as possible:

- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection, etc.)
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the application are affected
- **Severity**: How critical you believe the vulnerability is
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, provide a safe proof of concept
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, and any relevant details

### 4. **Response Timeline**

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and tested

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   - Regularly update your local development environment
   - Monitor for security advisories in dependencies

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit sensitive data to version control
   - Use strong, unique API keys
   - Rotate keys regularly

3. **Firebase Security**
   - Use proper Firebase database rules
   - Enable Firebase Authentication
   - Monitor Firebase Console for unusual activity

4. **Deployment Security**
   - Use HTTPS only in production
   - Configure proper CORS settings
   - Monitor application logs

### For Contributors

1. **Code Security**
   - Validate all user input
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper authentication checks
   - Follow OWASP guidelines

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Regularly update dependencies
   - Monitor for known vulnerabilities
   - Use `npm audit` to check for issues

3. **API Security**
   - Validate API inputs
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use proper error handling
   - Log security events

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

1. **Authentication**
   - Firebase Authentication with email/password
   - Invitation code system for access control
   - Session management and timeout

2. **Data Protection**
   - User data isolation in separate database paths
   - Firebase database rules enforcing user access
   - HTTPS-only connections

3. **Input Validation**
   - Client-side validation for user inputs
   - Server-side validation for API endpoints
   - Proper error handling and sanitization

4. **API Security**
   - OpenAI API key kept server-side
   - FormData parsing with formidable
   - Proper CORS configuration

## Known Security Considerations

### Firebase Realtime Database

- **User Isolation**: Each user's data is stored in separate paths
- **Database Rules**: Enforce user-specific access control
- **No SQL Injection**: Firebase handles query sanitization

### OpenAI Whisper API

- **API Key Security**: Keys are stored server-side only
- **Audio Processing**: Audio files are processed securely
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent abuse

### Authentication

- **Firebase Auth**: Industry-standard authentication
- **Invitation Codes**: Prevent unauthorized signups
- **Session Management**: Automatic session handling

## Security Updates

### How We Handle Security Updates

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate the severity and impact
2. **Fix Development**: Create and test security patches
3. **Testing**: Thorough testing in staging environment
4. **Deployment**: Deploy fixes to production
5. **Notification**: Notify users of security updates
6. **Documentation**: Update security documentation

### Security Release Process

1. **Private Fix**: Develop fix in private branch
2. **Testing**: Test fix thoroughly
3. **Release**: Create security release
4. **Deployment**: Deploy to production
5. **Disclosure**: Public disclosure after deployment

## Contact Information

For security-related issues, please contact:

- **Email**: [Security Email] (replace with actual email)
- **Response Time**: Within 48 hours
- **Encryption**: PGP key available upon request
