## Common Issues

### Authentication Issues

#### "Invalid invitation code"
- **Cause**: Invitation code validation failing
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_INVITATION_CODES` is set correctly
  - Check that codes are comma-separated without spaces
  - Ensure the code matches exactly (case-sensitive)
  - Restart the development server after changing environment variables

#### "Authentication failed"
- **Cause**: Firebase Authentication issues
- **Solution**:
  - Verify Firebase Authentication is enabled
  - Check that Email/Password provider is enabled
  - Ensure authorized domains are configured
  - Check browser console for specific error messages

#### "No entries visible"
- **Cause**: User not authenticated or wrong data path
- **Solution**:
  - Check that user is logged in
  - Verify Firebase Auth is working
  - Check browser console for authentication status
  - Ensure database rules allow user access

### Voice Recording Issues

#### "Voice recording not working"
- **Cause**: Audio recording configuration problems
- **Solution**:
  - Check that `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set
  - Verify API key has sufficient credits
  - Check microphone permissions in browser
  - Test API key separately

#### "Invalid audio format" Whisper error
- **Cause**: Audio format detection issues
- **Solution**:
  - Uses RecordRTC with proper FormData parsing
  - Ensures correct filename extension matches actual audio format
  - Mobile browsers require proper FormData parsing

#### "Microphone permission denied"
- **Cause**: Browser blocking microphone access
- **Solution**:
  - Allow microphone permissions in browser settings
  - Check if microphone is being used by another application
  - Try refreshing the page and granting permissions again

### Database Issues

#### "Firebase connection failed"
- **Cause**: Firebase configuration problems
- **Solution**:
  - Check that Firebase environment variables are set
  - Verify your Firebase project is active
  - Ensure Realtime Database is created
  - Check that database rules allow access

#### "Permission denied"
- **Cause**: Database rules too restrictive
- **Solution**:
  - Set rules to allow read/write in test mode
  - Ensure user is authenticated for production rules
  - Check that user has access to their data path

### Mobile Issues

#### "App doesn't work on mobile"
- **Cause**: Mobile-specific compatibility issues
- **Solution**:
  - Check mobile browser compatibility
  - Ensure responsive design is working
  - Test touch interactions
  - Verify audio recording works on mobile

#### "Text preview not working on mobile"
- **Cause**: CSS line clamping issues
- **Solution**:
  - Uses custom `.line-clamp-3` class
  - Improved logic to detect when text is longer than three lines
  - Check that Tailwind CSS is properly configured

npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment

#### "Vercel deployment fails"
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is The Breadcrumb Project?**
A: A secure, multi-user journaling app that helps you leave a trail of wisdom for your kids to follow after you're gone. It features Firebase Authentication, AI-powered voice transcription, and real-time synchronization.

**Q: Is it free to use?**
A: The app itself is free and open source. You'll need to set up your own Firebase project and OpenAI API key, which have their own costs (Firebase has a generous free tier, OpenAI charges per use).

**Q: Can I use it without an invitation code?**
A: No, invitation codes are required for new user registration to control access to the app.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: Yes, your data is stored securely in Firebase Realtime Database with user isolation. Each user's data is completely separate and protected by Firebase Authentication.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What browsers are supported?**
A: The app works on all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Mobile browsers are also supported.

**Q: Does voice recording work on mobile?**
A: Yes, voice recording works on mobile browsers using RecordRTC for cross-browser compatibility.

**Q: Can I use my own domain?**
A: Yes, you can deploy the app to your own domain using Vercel's custom domain feature.

**Q: How do I migrate existing data?**
A: The app includes migration tools to move data from the old shared structure to user-specific paths. See DATABASE.md for details.

### Feature Questions

**Q: Can multiple users access the same account?**
A: No, each user has their own account and data. The app is designed for individual use with secure user isolation.

**Q: Can I export my data?**
A: You can export data from Firebase Console, or we can add an export feature if needed.

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**
A: Currently it's a web app that works on mobile browsers. A native mobile app could be developed in the future.
